## Technologies

<details>
<summary>Expand to see technologies used</summary>

## Javascript

Javascript was used to put everything together. We implemented the npm react. It allowed us to make a single page application. I made use of a lot of array methods in this particular app. I used both the sort and filter method to help with how the table data is display on the screen.  I used the map method to create dynamic elements.

## React

React did a lot of heavy lifting for this application. The whole application was created using react. We start off with the index page that is where we start with our connections to a div in the index.html. The rest of how our application looks relies on App.js. The script files that start with a capital letter are called components. They This is how we add content dynamically. We import different components to display the page. Depending on what is occurring on the page different things will display. There are event listeners, onChange, onClick, onSubmit and each on can be programmed to do different things. I make uses of onClick that will cycle through the pages. I also used two hooks useLocation to get the location pathname, and useState to set up states that would help to manipulate data for portfolio page.  

### NPM

I used npm to install the following dependencies react, gh-pages, bootstrap, framer-motion, react-router-dom. 

#### Framer Motion

With this installed it made it very easy to implement some animation to my portfolio. I just need to add in two components AnimatePresence and motion. The animate presence allowed us to use the motion component in the rest of the application. Motion allowed us to actually animate different components. 

#### React Router Dom.

These page were static and didn't actually make full use of the router. They just help us with path names. Just thought I'd get used to how to implement it and syntax, for when I will have to use it later on to make api calls and set data in data bases. 

#### React Bootstrap

I mainly used this for my navigation.

## HTML

With React there was only the need of a single index page. The app actually works as a single page so there wasn't a need for more than on display.

## CSS

I used a mix of bootstrap classes, inline styling, and also css files to help with responsiveness .
